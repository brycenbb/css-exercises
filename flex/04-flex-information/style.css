/* Lessons learned: text-align should be like in the solution, put into the body
  tag instead of repeating it constantly. I also originally used space-between instead
  of center which was a clear mistake on my end. The max-width part was misinterpreted
  as I had orginally put it as width to 200 instead of max width, making it look a bit
  wonky. */
